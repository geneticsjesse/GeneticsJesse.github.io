##  Jesse is an aspiring scientist and recent M.Sc. graduate from Trent University, with a B.Sc. from the University of Guelph.
# Research Interests
My interests are eclectic and dynamic, but academically, are primarily focused on integrating genetic and genomic techniques into ecological settings to inform conservation management
# Technical Experience
I have worked in the alpine mountains of British Columbia and across southwestern Ontario, as well as as in northern Iceland. 
I have 2+ years of experience:
* Handling and researching multiple aquatic species in both field and experimental settings
* In wet labs working with DNA to generate genetic and genomic data
* Collaborating with numerous stakeholders to generate multiple primary author research publications as well as joint governmental reports and project updates for funding agencies
# Leadership Experience
I am passionate about the ShutDownSTEM movement and am part of a working group that meets weekly to devote time to education and to make plans to eradicate systemic racism in science and beyond. 
I am also an interim board member for the Ontario Chapter of the Wildlife Society, tasked with helping plan our AGM and other general organizational duties.
